TextCommands
============

Sublime Text 2 Plugin including a variety of commands for manipulating/navigating text

================================================================================

There are things that humans excel at. Creativity, free thinking, visual processing.

Editing text is not one of those things.

In every document, there will crop up moments when some menial task threatens to throw you off your groove.
Sublime Text does an excellent job of making many of these things easier, with multiple selections and its many other
wonderful features. Still, menial tasks are what computers excel at. You shouldn't have to write out numbers in a sequence
from 1 to N. You shouldn't have to sort words or phrases.  You shouldn't have to keep track of how many selections you have,
you shouldn't have to convert things to hexadecimal by hand, and you shouldn't have to count how many characters are in a 
string.

That's where TextCommands comes in.

It's a collection of commands that are tested in the field.

I edit thousands of lines of XML by hand on a regular basis, and I do best to automate the things that I find menial and repetitive.
You can benefit from my automation.

So, enjoy a free pass to become more productive in your text editing. If you think of something to add, feel free to 
either do a pull request or file a bug report.
